# SortingVisualiser
Visualising different sorting algorithms.

The algorithms visualized here are:
1.Bubble Sort
2.Insertion Sort
3.Selection Sort
4.Heap Sort
5.Merge Sort

I've used HTML,CSS & Javascript to build this project to implement my frontend skill and the programs of the sorting algorithms are written in Javascript
